# Email Components

This directory contains the organized email-related components for the application. The components have been restructured for better maintainability and organization.

## Structure

```
/components/email/
├── uploader/           # Email upload functionality
│   ├── EmailUploader.tsx  # Main uploader component
│   └── index.ts           # Public exports
│
├── selector/           # Email listing and selection
│   ├── EmailList.tsx      # Email list with selection
│   └── index.ts           # Public exports
│
└── preview/            # Email preview functionality
    ├── EmailPreview.tsx   # Email preview component
    └── index.ts           # Public exports
```

## Changes Made

1. **Reorganized Email Components**
   - Split email functionality into three main categories: uploader, selector, and preview
   - Each component is now in its own directory with its own exports
   - Improved type safety with TypeScript

2. **New Component Structure**
   - `EmailUploader`: Handles file uploads with drag-and-drop support
   - `EmailList`: Displays and manages the list of emails
   - `EmailPreview`: Shows email content with device previews

3. **Improvements**
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Easier to maintain and test individual components
   - More consistent code organization
   - Backward-compatible exports

## Usage

Import components from their respective directories:

```tsx
import { EmailUploader } from '@/components/email/uploader';
import { EmailList } from '@/components/email/selector';
import { EmailPreview } from '@/components/email/preview';
```

## Notes

- Old components were backed up to `~/Downloads/KEEPSAFE/email_components_backup_[DATE]`
- All imports should be updated to use the new paths
- The new structure follows React best practices for component organization
